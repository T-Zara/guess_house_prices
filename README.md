# 🏠 House Price Predictor  

This project is a simple **Machine Learning + Streamlit web app** that predicts house prices using the **California Housing dataset**.  

It has two main parts:  
1. **Model training script** → trains a Linear Regression model and saves it.  
2. **Streamlit app** → loads the model and provides a user-friendly interface to make predictions.
